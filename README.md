# Philsophy
- plain text, no special/proprietary data format
- human readable, especially in a monospaced font
- intuitive: musically inclined readers can guess the basics without reading this
- code-able: composed of strings that can easily be generated/concatenated algorithmically
  - music is all patterns and variations on those patterns...
  - ... so is code
  - expressing music with code gives us a chance to make the patterns and variations clear
    even clearer than they are in conventional sheet music
  - ... and perhaps compose differently because we have the structural aspects at our
    fingertips

# Examples
Some music:
```
--- --- --- E4  --- --- --- E4
--- --- G3  --- --- --- G3  ---
--- C3  --- --- --- C3  --- ---
C2  --- --- --- C2  --- --- ---

--- --- --- F4  --- --- --- F4
--- --- B3  --- --- --- B3  ---
--- G3  --- --- --- G3  --- ---
G2  --- --- --- G2  --- --- ---

--- --- E4  --- --- --- --- E4
--- G3  --- --- --- G3  --- ---
--- --- --- C3  --- --- C3  ---
C2  --- --- --- C2  --- --- ---

--- --- F4  --- --- --- --- F4
--- B3  --- --- --- B3  --- ---
--- --- --- G3  --- --- G3  ---
G2  --- --- --- G2  --- --- ---
```
